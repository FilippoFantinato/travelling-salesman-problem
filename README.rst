Travelling Salesman Problem
===========================

The Travelling Salesman Problem is one of the most NP-hard famous problem. It asks you the following question:

..

    Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?
